# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-27

Initial release to telegram-tools parity (v1 contract in `SPEC.md`). Published
as `discord-tools-cli` (the plain name is squatted on PyPI); the command is
`discord-tools`:

- `auth`: guided Developer Portal setup — walkthrough, hidden token paste,
  live verification, message-content-intent re-check loop, invite URL with the
  right permission bits, token stored per profile in `~/.discord-tools/.env`
  (0600).
- `doctor`: offline checks (Python, config, token shape, allowlist counts) and
  live checks (login, message-content intent, joined servers); `--channel`
  adds per-permission checks and an empty-content probe.
- `discover`: server → channel → active-thread tree with IDs, `--server`,
  `--json`.
- `search`: paginated history fetch + local filtering (keyword, author, date
  bounds, limit) with an early stop at `--since`; exports to JSON/CSV under
  `~/.discord-tools/exports/` by default.
- `send`: full-message preview + y/N; `--yes` gated by
  `DISCORD_SEND_ALLOWLIST` (unset = refuse); attachment support with
  pre-confirm existence checks.
- `create channel|category|thread`: confirmation previews naming what will
  exist where.
- `clear-messages`: dry-run by default reporting the 14-day bulk/single split
  from snowflake math; execution requires `--execute` + typed `DELETE`; bulk
  endpoint for recent messages, paced one-by-one deletes beyond it.
- `bot`: profile view (identity, description, avatar, intent, invite URL);
  edits behind a diff + confirm; `--invite`.
- Human menu on bare invocation mirroring telegram-tools; every destructive
  action goes through the same gates as the flags.
- Bundled agent skill (`skill/SKILL.md`).
